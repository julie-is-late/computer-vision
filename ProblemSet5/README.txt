I have created the wireframe and untextured models, but I had a decent amount
of trouble trying to get the texture extraction to work. This is something I
would have come and talked with you about, but unfortunately I had a very busy
week and was working on this at the last minute (and more). I think some of
this problem set was very difficult, but really cool to see the models be made
once finished. I had to come up with a few "hacks" to get everything to come
together, like in one instance where I didn't have 3 planes worth of points to
find the point in the bottom right of the building. Because I didn't know how
to represent a line in P3, I instead opted to take the points on that line and
add the origin point to form a plane that way.
