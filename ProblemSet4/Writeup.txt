This was a bit of a tough problem set. I think mostly because there were a lot 
of times where I was a bit unsure about whether I was on the right track or 
not. It is sometimes difficult to tell if one matrix is correct when you 
compare it to a different possible one. This is propogated latter on when 
you're unsure if something isn't exact because of an actual mistake or purely
because of error in the sampling of the data. Forexample, depending on what 
points you choose in the image, the epipolar lines may be slightly off from the
corresponding point in the other image. Is this just error? or is one of my 
processes off. 

Also, somethings were more difficult than I think they maybe needed to be. For 
example, normalizing the intput points was surprizingly confusing, as I've 
never had to do anything like that. But some quick google-foo helped me get 
past that.

Other thoughts:
    the shed diary was very useful, as it helped me not get too far off
    I still hate matlab. Despite being very powerful with this I am still 
        tripping over common syntactical issues.
    Thanks for extending the deadline, even though I'm getting it done on time 
        it helps it be a lot less stressful.
    
I'm actually excited for next milestone where we can (hopefully) plot the 
points in 3D like you did in class. I've understood that's what we've been 
working towards for a while, but it is still nonetheless cool.
