Problem 3)
Because the answer to problem 2 is purely an affine reflection rectification,
it does not rectify the skew on the image. Although both answers eliminate the
vanishing points created by the parallel sides of the tiles and make all of
the lines parallel, the solution to problem 1 is better able to make the
perpendicular sides appear more perpendicular. The solution to problem 2 keeps
roughly the same angle on the crossing lines, which is what causes the vertical
squashing of the image.
